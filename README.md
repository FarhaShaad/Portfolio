## Trader Performance Analysis
This project explores the relationship between market sentiment and cryptocurrency trading performance. By integrating Fear & Greed Index data with real trading records, it uncovers behavioral patterns in decision-making, profitability, and trade direction under different sentiment conditions such as Fear, Greed, Extreme Greed, and Neutral.

📌 Key Highlights:

Data Integration: Merged public sentiment data (Fear & Greed Index) with real-world trade logs based on timestamps.

Data Cleaning & Processing: Handled inconsistent formats, parsed dates, managed missing classifications, and standardized features for analysis.

🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Distribution of trades under each sentiment.

Win rate and average PnL per sentiment.

BUY vs SELL behavior across market conditions.

📊 Visualizations:

* PnL distribution under fear vs greed (bar chart)

* PnL distribution by sentiment (Box Plot)

* PnL over time by sentiment (Line chart)

* Number of trades per sentiment (Bar chart)

* Buy vs Sell comparison (Pie chart)  

✅ Insights Derived:

Lower win rates and higher volatility during periods of Fear.

Greed-driven trades showed higher average profitability but also risk.

BUY trades were more frequent during Greed, while SELL trades increased under Fear.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies:

Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Data wrangling, datetime handling, and group-based analysis






## Fake News Detection System
This project focuses on detecting misleading or false information in news articles using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and supervised learning techniques. With misinformation being a growing threat, especially across digital platforms, the goal was to build a robust classification model that can distinguish between real and fake news.

🔍 Key Objectives
Classify news headlines/articles as real or fake

Apply text preprocessing techniques (tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization)

Generate semantic meaning using Word2Vec embeddings

Train a Logistic Regression model for binary classification

Evaluate model performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and ROC curve

🛠️ Tech Stack
Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, NLTK, Gensim, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Modeling: Word2Vec + Logistic Regression

Data: Sourced from a labeled dataset of fake and real news headlines/articles

📊 Approach
Data Cleaning: Removed noise such as punctuation, special characters, and stopwords.

Tokenization & Lemmatization: Prepared the text for embedding.

Vectorization: Used Word2Vec to convert text into numerical vectors by averaging word embeddings.

Model Training: Trained a logistic regression model to classify the articles.

Evaluation: Achieved good accuracy with balanced results across both classes.

✅ Outcome
Developed a scalable pipeline for text-based classification.

Gained deeper understanding of NLP preprocessing and word embeddings.

Demonstrated how classical ML methods can perform well when combined with strong feature engineering.

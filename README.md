## Trader Performance Analysis
This project explores the relationship between market sentiment and cryptocurrency trading performance. By integrating Fear & Greed Index data with real trading records, it uncovers behavioral patterns in decision-making, profitability, and trade direction under different sentiment conditions such as Fear, Greed, Extreme Greed, and Neutral.

Key Highlights:

Data Integration: Merged public sentiment data (Fear & Greed Index) with real-world trade logs based on timestamps.

Data Cleaning & Processing: Handled inconsistent formats, parsed dates, managed missing classifications, and standardized features for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Distribution of trades under each sentiment.

Win rate and average PnL per sentiment.

BUY vs SELL behavior across market conditions.

Visualizations:

PnL distribution by sentiment (histograms/boxplots)

Trade volume per sentiment (bar charts)

Side (BUY/SELL) distribution (stacked bars & pie charts)

Time series of profit/loss trends across sentiment periods

Insights Derived:

Lower win rates and higher volatility during periods of Fear.

Greed-driven trades showed higher average profitability but also risk.

BUY trades were more frequent during Greed, while SELL trades increased under Fear.

Tools & Technologies:

Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Data wrangling, datetime handling, and group-based analysis
